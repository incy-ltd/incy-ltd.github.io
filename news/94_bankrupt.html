        <h1>1994 - Incy Ltd. EOL</h1>
        Last year, our company has started to struggle more and more with money.
        Due to this, we have decided that it was no longer worth it to maintainn this company,
        and we went bankrupt.
        It's been a fun 7 years. Maybe fate will bring us back together one day?
        <h2>What will happen to the products?</h2>
        Our products most likely will not be maintained anymore. We'll try to publish the source code somewhere,
        but we can't promise anything. Sorry about that.
        <h2>How did this happen?</h2>
        It all started a few months ago, <i>someone</i> at our company has been repeatetly toxic to other coworkers,
        they have been stealing all of our lunches, and they've also been using the company bank account to purchase
        personal items. After we had terminated that person, we realized how much debt they'd actually earned us.
        <br><br>
        To cut things short, we have just not been able to recover well from all of this. Sadly, our employees have
        to look for new jobs now. But I guess that's just life, isn't it?
